3.1.1.1 The rover navigation controller shall provide interfaces for on-board control, and remote control by the operations team.
1) When in remotely controlled mode, the speed must be limited by the rover navigation controller to 3 km/h with a target speed of 5 km/h
2) For the on-board control, the rover navigation controller should limit the speed to 5 km/h with a target speed of 10 km/h
3.1.1.2 When receiving commands from multiple sources, the rover navigation controller prioritizes and arbitrates the commands received from all sources to ensure that the most appropriate source is used.
The navigation controller shall maintain a copy on-board of all the priority constraints of all sources.
3.1.1.3 A safe mode switch is available to turn the remote control off when the latency or jitter is too high.
3.1.1.4 An emergency stop switch is provided on-board to interrupt all functions and movements automatically, even if the rover is in the remotely controlled mode.
