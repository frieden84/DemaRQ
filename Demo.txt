3.1.1 Controller Requirements 
3.1.1.1 The rover navigation controller shall provide interfaces for on-board control, and remote control by the operations team.
Ease of use and control for all functions.

1.	When in remotely controlled mode, the speed must be limited by the rover navigation controller to 3 km/h with a target speed of 5 km/h
This is because in the remote-controlled mode, that there is a likely delay â‰§ 20ms in information transfer from the controller to the operations centre.

2.	For the on-board control, the rover navigation controller should limit the speed to 5 km/h with a target speed of 10 km/h
Observe that the speed is higher in on-board control as the navigation is based on real front views, side-camera views, and the sensory information.

3.1.1.2 When receiving commands from multiple sources, the rover navigation controller prioritizes and arbitrates the commands received from all sources to ensure that the most appropriate source is used. 
Note: This is intended to avoid situations where rover controller will receive contradictory commands from multiple sources. The navigation controller shall maintain a copy on-board of all the priority constraints of all sources. 

3.1.1.3 A safe mode switch is available to turn the remote control off when the latency or jitter is too high.

3.1.1.4 An emergency stop switch is provided on-board to interrupt all functions and movements automatically, even if the rover is in the remotely controlled mode.
